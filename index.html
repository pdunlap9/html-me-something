        <h2 id="bogarts" class="jobname">Bogart's Smokehouse</h2>
        <h3 class="jobdates"> April 2017 - September 2020 </h3>
        <p class="described">Bogart's was a fun and laid back place to work. All of the employees and owners were like my family. 
            It was important to make every customer feel comfortable and  have an easy experience.
            It was a very small building and we were all very close knit. I became a shift leader pretty quickly after I started there.

            <summary>More Information About Bogart's Smokehouse</summary>
            <p class= "info">Bogart's is a tiny restaurant owned by the same owners of the more wellknown Pappy's Smokehouse. While the menu is similar,
                Bogart's food is quite different. Due to the smaller amount of clientelle each day, they are able to take their time, and make smaller
                batches of food each day. Even though the building is small, and the lines are long do not be decieved. Service is quick and friendly.
